This Project has 4 Components - Customer App, Vendor App, Web Admin Panel, Firestore Database

The 3 in this folder are Customer, Vendor, and Web admin

I have joined the customer and vendor app successfully so there is no need to run the complete clean app and vendor only folder seperately. In real circumstances both applications would be two seperate apps but because my computer is really slow and crashes, I could not run them both separatetly at the same time as I feared it could damage the CPU.

I have still included the seperate vendor only folder just for history and evidence of development.

please make an account and log in to both the customer and vendor apps for better user experience. if you run into any issues while going through the screen before the demo it might just be you have/havent signed in/signed out so just keep mindful of such

please feel free to experiment till the demo date, where I will go through all components to your high standards
Thank you
